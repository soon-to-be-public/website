# What self-compassion means to me

_This is a short article on what self-compassion means to me. It's not intended to be a comprehensive description of what self-compassion is; if anything, you'll find it deals with a pretty narrow flavour of self-compassion._

I've found self-compassion especially helpful for dealing with unfulfilled ambitions. For example, it's pretty common for me to feel guilty about not doing work when I'm resting, even if I'm slightly tired. 

When I was in my teens, I used to think being ambitious and having high standards for myself was unavoidably associated with fear and pain. The hypothetical **fear** of not meeting my own standards, and the **pain** of having actually fallen short them. For example, I used to feel intensely sad when I got a bad grade, and fearful of receiving bad grades. 

Not just that, but when I considered letting go of the pain of a bad grade, I thought the only way to achieve that was to stop caring about grades. But I liked caring about grades and didn't want to become unambitious. 

I don't think that way anymore, and I think this is thanks to a specific brand of _self-compassion_. The key insights for me were: 
1. Sometimes your body needs rest.
2. Ambition and self-reproach are unrelated axes. 
## Sometimes your body needs rest 
(or sleep, or distance from someone, or a quiet night in, or to do something mindless for a few hours...)

You can just ask yourself "what do I need right now?". For me, it's funny how this question can immediately illuminate the situation and make me feel better about getting what I truly need in that moment. 

Sometimes resting is literally the most productive thing you can do. You're recharging yourself for another day. 

(I do also recommend learning to appreciate rest as something nice you do for yourself, **for its own sake and because you love yourself**.)

## Ambition and self-reproach are unrelated axes.
i.e. you can be ambitious without endlessly beating yourself up. You can also be very reproachful towards yourself without much of an effect on your ambition or you ability to attain your goals.

I used to be afraid that if I didn't feel enough suffering for my bad choices (e.g. getting a B+ instead of an A because I procrastinated on studying for the test!) I wouldn't remember not to repeat those bad choices in the future. 

I wish I could say to that version of myself: girl, you have such high standards. I guarantee you won't forget about them even if you just take it easy for a day or two. 

Sure - sometimes if I chill too hard I might forget about some smaller meaningless tasks I might need to do. On any given day, I can easily forget that I meant to call HMRC to ask about my taxes, or forget something that was on my shopping list. But my basic, core values and character traits? They can survive me spending 48 hours in a 5 star hotel with complimentary luxury spa treatments. 

If you're like me, even when you rest you often feel a small pang of pain. You run this constant process of evaluation in the background. Could you be more productive right now? Could you be studying? Could you be doing admin? _That's your ambition talking. Your north star. You'd struggle to get it to leave if you tried. It may change shapes from a moment to another, but if you look for it, it'll still be there, in some form._ 

If you're ever worried, ask yourself: "Am I truly ambition-less right now? Is there nothing I'm striving for?". Chances are, you'll find something you care about.  

I feel a lot more confident in my drive and in my ambition these days, and, ultimately, I don't see it as a bottleneck at all. Again, this is because I'm constantly running this evaluation process in the background, or how productive I'm being. I think _that_ is ambition. 

Self-reproach is sometimes just a facet of this ambition - often, just the tip of the iceberg. Punishment is what I feel tempted to do to myself when I have so much unfulfilled ambition it spills out. I don't really need to hang on to it to feel motivated to achieve my goals.

And with that, it becomes so much easier to let it go. I can focus on rest and energy because _I don't have to punish myself_, and they're actively in synergy with what I want.
